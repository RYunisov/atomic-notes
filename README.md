# Welcome to atomic-notes

## :sparkles: POV:

Here are a couple of ideas for starting the repository:

- Make a habit of acquiring new IT knowledge every day;
- The place where I can refresh lost things;
- The one pocket for workday notes;

## Would you like to improve a project?

Feel free, repo is open to new vision...
